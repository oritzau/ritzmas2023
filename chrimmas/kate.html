    <h3>I couldn't think of anything particularly funny or useful to put here
        so here is a note instead:</h3>
    <p>Dear Kate,</p>
    <p>I'm really glad you found something you're truly passionate about. 
        Music, especially music education, could sorely use more talented and 
        driven people like you. As someone who feels like they really know 
        "what the want", I somtimes get that nagging sensations that 
        without my 'thing', I wouldn't matter. I hope you know that if someday 
        you wake up and decide you never want to hear a note again in your life,
        I will still be proud of you and the person you've become. That if
        you decide your true calling is to be a bass fisherman in Lousiana
        till the day you drop that I would still be proud of you. No matter
        where you end up or how you choose to live, remember that I will always
        be in your corner.
    </p>
