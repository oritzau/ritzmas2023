    <h3>Here's a very classy sailing joke for you, I hope you like it</h3>
A sailor on a Navy ship had been out to sea for weeks, and was beginning to go through sex withdrawals. He asked one of his shipmates what he did when the pressure was too much to take. 
        <p>"Well, there's a barrel with a hole in it near the mop storage. When it gets to be too much for us, we use that."</p>
So the sailor went over to the barrel and decided to give it a go. Finding it was better than he'd expected, he began using it regularly, and his problems seemed to vanish. 
After a couple of weeks, his commanding officer began to take notice, and said: 

    <p>"You seem to be a lot more relaxed. What's your secret?"</p> 
    The sailor, embarrassed to give a straight answer, simply said he'd been getting better rest.
    <p>"Well you're going to need it," replied the officer. "Today's your day in the barrel."</p>
