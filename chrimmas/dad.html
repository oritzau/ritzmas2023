    <r>Not sure if this will be fun for you, but I couldn't think of anything
        clever to put here so I thought I'd make a puzzle
    <div>
        <h2>Hints:</h2>
        <r>There are three hints available (one for each puzzle). To access the hints, 
            use the codes HINT1, HINT2, and HINT3 on the 
            <a href="/index.html">homepage</a></r>
    </div>
    <h2>Rules:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Don't use inspect element. I don't know html that well,
            so it is trivially easy to find all the solutions that way.
        </li>
        <li>You are welcome to run the code snippet found in problem 2, it may 
            or may not help</li>
        <li>Don't have any fun. That is <b>strictly</b> against the principle of this
            puzzle</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Question 1:</h2>
        For any positive integer k, the sum of all x^3 up to and including k, beginning
        at x = 1, is equal to ((k(k+1))2)^2
